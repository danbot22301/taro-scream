<h1>The Beauty of Noise</h1>
<h2>Weaponizing Annoyance</h2>


<p>
Its not easy to get your point across if you can't talk! Luckily, birds have found a solution to this conundrum; in the event you want or need something, just start screaming 
  your little feathered head off. Hungry? <b>Scream</b>. Scared? <b>Scream.</b> Tired? <b>Scream</b>, and then close your eyes. While this is a primative method of communication, one cannot 
overstate its usefulness once both parties understand the message. Noisemaking isn't just an effective tool however, its also a lot of fun! nothing can cast off boredom 
like making as great a raucous as is possible.
